Dear Laravel,

You are an incredible framework. You have helped us create and maintain online projects that really work, which are easy to develop, grow and distribute. We become better programmers thanks to you, who leads us to good practices, has an incredible ORM, has fantastic documentation, incorporates new improvements every day, and has a spectacular ecosystem.

Inspired by the [Thank You Github repository](https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github), we thank to you, [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) , all its [contributors](https://github.com/laravel/framework/graphs/contributors), [Laracasts](http://laracasts.com) and [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay), [Laravel News](http://laravel-news.com) and all the Laravel ecosystem.
